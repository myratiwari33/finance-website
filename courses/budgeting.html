<p>Hello, and welcome to the Budgeting page of our project!
Here, we break down how we've planned our finances to bring this idea to life. Budgeting isn't just 
about numbers — it's about making smart choices, being resourceful, and turning great ideas into action, even on a small budget.</p><br>

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size:x-large" class="italic"><u>
Why Budgeting Matters&#128204;

</u>
    </p>
<p>
    Here's the thing. Budgeting helps you use your money wisely. 
    It ensures your resources go exactly where they're needed — nothing more, nothing less. 
    If you don't plan your money, it disappears faster than your weekend.
</p> 
<p class="italic" style="text-align: center;">“A budget is telling your money where to go instead of wondering where it went.”</p>

        <ul class="myfont">
<li>Use free stuff first. There's sooo much online that costs absolutely nothing.</li>
<li>Make a quick tracker in Google Sheets or Notes app 📱</li>
<li>Keep some “oops” money aside. Always.</li>
<li>Ask teachers or mentors for help — they might surprise you with support!</li>
</ul><br>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size:x-large" class="italic"><u>Budgeting= Life Skill💬</u></p>
<p>Let's be real: we're not just budgeting for this project —
We're learning how to budget in life.
Whether it's for college, starting a startup someday,
 or planning a trip with friends, this experience showed us that being smart with money isn't just useful, it's powerful. </p><br>
 <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size:x-large" class="italic"><u>🧁 How to Actually Budget (Let's Say You're Throwing a Party 🎉)</u></p>
<p>Okay, imagine you're planning a birthday party with your friends. Here's how you'd do it:</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Start with everything you think you'll need. For example:</p>
<ol class="myfont">
    
    <li>🍕Food & drinks</li>
    <li>🎈Decorations</li>
    <li>🔊Speakers/music setup</li>
    <li>🎂Cake</li>
    <li>📸Photographer or camera</li>
   <li> 🎉Party games</li>
    <li>🧻Random stuff (cups, napkins, backup snacks)</li>

</ol>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">
    Now, write down how much each thing might cost:
</p>
<ol class="myfont">
    <li>Pizza: ₹800</li>
    <li>Cake: ₹600</li>
    <li>Balloons & streamers: ₹300</li>
    <li>Renting a speaker: ₹200</li>
    <li>Cups & plates: ₹150</li>
    <li>Total: ₹2,050</li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">
    Let's say you only have ₹1,500. So what do you do?
</p>
<ul class="myfont">
    <li>Ask a friend to bring a speaker instead of renting = ₹0</li>
    <li>Use old party decorations = ₹0</li>
    <li>Bake a cake at home = ₹300</li>
    <li>Now you're down to just ₹1,100!</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">
    You can use Google Sheets or even your Notes app to list:
</p>
<ul class="myfont">
    <li>What you're spending on</li>
    <li>How much you planned to spend</li>
    <li>How much you actually spent</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Set aside ₹200-₹300 in case:</p>
<ul class="myfont">
    <li>You need to buy more snacks</li>
    <li>Someone forgets cups</li>
    <li>The cake falls on the floor (😭 yes, it happens)</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">You threw an awesome party, stayed under budget, and didn't have to panic-beg your parents for more money. THAT is the power of budgeting.

</p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size:x-large" class="italic"><u>Budgeting = Big Brain Energy 🧠💸</u></p>
<p>So yeah, budgeting actually eats. We started with just ideas and a little bit of cash… and ended up building something awesome.
    We didn't just manage money — we learned to think smarter, work better, and do more with less. </p>
